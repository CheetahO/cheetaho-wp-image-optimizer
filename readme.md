## About the plugin
* You can use your CheetahO API key on as many sites/blogs as you like. We have no per-site license.
* All images uploaded throught the media uploader are optimized on-the-fly. All generated thumbnails are optimized too.
* All images already present in the media library can be optimized individually, or using the Bulk Action.
* All optimization is carried out by sending images to CheetahO, and pulling the optimized files to your Wordpress installation.
* All full size images can be resized/rescaled before optimization by setting maximum width and height.
* To use this plugin, you must obtain a full API key from CheetahO [panel](https://app.cheetaho.com/admin/api-credentials).

Once you have obtained your credentials, from your Wordpress admin, go to the settings page and there you can enter your API credentials, and select your optimization preferences. Once you have done this, click on **Save**. If everything is in order, it will simply say "settings saved" and give you a reassuring green tick that your credentials are valid. You can now start optimizing images from within Media Library. Any image you upload from now on, through any of the media upload screens will be optimized on-the-fly.

Please send bug reports, problems, feature requests and so on to support (at) cheetaho dot com, or directly to the author of this plugin.
